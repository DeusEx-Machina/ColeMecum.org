    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
    <script>
        var total = 0;
        for( var counter = 0; counter < 1000; counter++){
            if(counter % 3 === 0 || counter % 5 === 0){
                total += counter;
            }
        }
        $('#problem1').append('<p>'+ total + '</p>');

    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
